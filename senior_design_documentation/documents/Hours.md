# Summary of Hours and Justification

## Fall
I spent a minimum of 50 hours on this project in the Fall. Most of the time was spent in design and prototyping of the project (20 hours). Following, the time spent learning Kotlin and the packages I used (Ktor, OkHttp - roughly 15 hours). After this, I spent about 10 hours trying to implement and confirm some of the measurements that I needed. I also spent a significant amount of time on the documentation required for Senior Design.

## Spring
I spent a minimum of 40 hours on this project in the Spring. Most of this time was spent in finishing the implementation to produce a working library (20+ hours). I also spent around 15 hours on the Android app integration and fixing problems that arose because of it. I spent a significant amount of time on the documentation required for Senior Design, including the CEAS Expo presentation and PowerPoint.
