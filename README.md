## Project Abstract
This projectâ€™s goal is to make a library framework for the network responsiveness test described in [Responsiveness under Working Conditions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-responsiveness/) IETF draft. Following, to create an Android app that can utilize the library to run the test.  

The library will offer an API call to allow applications to integrate the responsiveness test. It will also provide a platform for future development of different implementations of the responsiveness test, allowing a wider range of devices to run it.   

The Android app will utilize this API call to give the Android platform access to the responsiveness test.
